\# Bitcoin Sentiment vs Trader Performance Analysis



This project explores how trader profitability and trading activity vary with market sentiment,  

using data from the \*\*Bitcoin Fear–Greed Index\*\* and \*\*Hyperliquid historical trades\*\*.



\## Overview

\- Analyzed trader performance metrics (`PnL`, `Win Rate`, `Volume`) across market sentiment phases.

\- Integrated two datasets:

&nbsp; - \*\*Fear–Greed Index\*\* (`sentiment\_value`, `sentiment\_label`)

&nbsp; - \*\*Hyperliquid Trader Data\*\* (`execution\_price`, `size\_usd`, `pnl`, etc.)

\- Discovered behavioral patterns linking trader psychology and profit outcomes.



\## Key Insights

\- Traders were most profitable during \*\*Extreme Greed\*\* phases.

\- Total trade volume peaked during \*\*Fear\*\*, indicating dip-buying behavior.

\- Neutral and Extreme Fear markets saw the lowest profits.



\## Tools Used

\- Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)

\- Google Colab 

\- Data visualization \& correlation analysis
